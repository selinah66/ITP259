# ITP259: Basics of Artificial Intelligence
This repository contains all code, projects, and assignments for the ITP 259: Foundations of Artificial Intelligence course at the University of Southern California (USC). The course covers the fundamental principles of artificial intelligence, including:

- Introduction to AI: History, core concepts, and different types of AI.
- Machine Learning Fundamentals: Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning, Regression, Classification.
- Neural Networks: Perceptrons, multi-layer perceptrons, backpropagation.
- Deep Learning: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image recognition, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential data.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into folders for each module or project.
- lectures/: Contains Jupyter notebooks and code examples from course lectures.
- assignments/: Contains code for all homework assignments. Each assignment is in its own sub-folder (e.g., assignment1, assignment2).
- final_project/: Contains the code for major projects.
- data/: Datasets used in assignments and projects.
- requirements.txt: List of all necessary Python libraries and their versions.
